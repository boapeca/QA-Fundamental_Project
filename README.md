### Brief

The objective of this project was "To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."
That being said I have decided to make an application that allows the user to read, add, edit and delete games from their own library. This has an aim of allowing the user to create libraries in their profile.

### Additional Requirements

I am also required to include the following:

* Kanban Board : Jira
* Documentation on the project
* A java based functional application
* <del> Testing
* Version Control System : Github
* CI server and GCP

### Application Requirements

To be able to produce a simple but functional Game Library application, it must contain or allow the user to do the following:

* Create a user account that stores:
  * User Name
  * Email
  * Password
* Allow the user to create libraries and games
* Edit games and libraries
* Delete any unwanted games or libraries
* View and update their account details
* Delete their account

### User Stories

For this project the user has to be able to interact and do certains actions with the web application. The user stories for the current iteration are as follows:

 * As an user I want to be able to register in the application to have a my own profile.
 * As an user I want to be able to able to see my Game Library. (Read)
 * As an user I want to be able to add Games to my Library. (Create)
 * As an user I want to be able to delete Games from my Library.(Delete)
 * As an user I want to be able to edit Games on my library. (Update)
 * As an user I want to be able to edit my name/password on my profile.
