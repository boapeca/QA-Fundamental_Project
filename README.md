### Brief

The objective of this project was "To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."
That being said I have decided to make an application that takes the users preferences in games and provide suggestions on what games they should play next.

* Kanban Board : Jira
* Documentation on the project
* A java based functional application
* Testing
* Version Control System : Github

* Delete saved games
