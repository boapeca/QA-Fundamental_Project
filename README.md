### Brief

The objective of this project was "To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."
That being said I have decided to make an application that takes the users preferences in games and provide suggestions on what games they should play next.

### Additional Requirements

I am also required to include the following:

* Kanban Board : Jira
* Documentation on the project
* A java based functional application
* Testing
* Version Control System : Github
* CI server and GCP

### Application Requirements

To be able to produce a simple but functional Game Suggestion application, it must contain or allow the user to do the following:

* Create a user account that stores:
  * User Name
  * Email
  * Password
* Generate Suggestions based on feedback given
* Save game suggestions on their profile/list
* Delete saved games
* View and update their account details
* Delete their account
